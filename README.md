## 📘 About the Project

This project provides a simple, menu-driven console interface to manage a small banking system. It allows bank staff (system users) to:

- create and manage client accounts,
- perform deposits, withdrawals, and transfers,
- track user activity and sessions.

The goal is to demonstrate how to build a structured C++ application using **classes**, **file handling**, and **modular design** to solve a real-world-like problem.
